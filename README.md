This tutorial provides the basic workflow for processing two-photon calcium imaging datasets from the Duopus microscope for cell extraction.

The tutorial assumes that you already have access to the following repositories, and that they are included in the Matlab path:

- [kimtonyhyun/analysis](https://github.com/kimtonyhyun/analysis)
- [kimtonyhyun/aux_analysis](https://github.com/kimtonyhyun/aux_analysis)

(Historically, `aux_analysis` consisted of less-polished scripts that were excluded from `analysis`, which was more rigorously maintained.)
