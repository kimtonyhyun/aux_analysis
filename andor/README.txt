The functions GetAndorSifData, GetAndorSifProperty, GetAndorSifSize have been superseded by the full atsifio interface that is available in the atsifio folder.

Sifreadexample demonstrates its use and it is also possible to access help on each function from the MATLAB command line like so:

>> help atsif_readfromfile.

To get up and running in MATLAB it is important that this folder (and subfolders) is added to the MATLAB path (*NB* if MATLAB is installed under Windows 7 it may be necessary to run as administrator in order to successfully save the new path).
